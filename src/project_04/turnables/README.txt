This program uses processing.org to create a canvas where you can draw
using circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles.

Running This Program
    You can run this program from the .jar file,
    TCollins_Project_04.java file (update the classpaths before you do)
    or the ShapePaint.java file.

    It's important to ensure you have the classpaths updated as the
    .java files were from 2 different projects that were interacting
    with each other. It was specifically the project ShapePaint.java
    was a part of was being included into the project
    TCollins_Project_04.java was made in.

KeyBinds:

    2:    Changes the outline color of the shape.
    3:    Changes the fill color of the shape.
    4:    Changes the color of the background.
    5:    Rotates the rectangle 90° at a time.

Feature (Extra Credit??? Hopefully???)
The shapes lay on top of each other in the order they are created,
regardless of which shape it is.
