            <h1>Update to Presentations with 25 References</h1>
            <p>
            When I first discussed my presentation, I mentioned how I was going to talk to the men of Israel United in Christ (I will refer to them as IUIC). As I've had 2 sessions with them, I think I realized I may not have a goal other than to witness. <br><br>

            Is that necessary? I would assume it is but I then have to admit that I didn't discuss much towards that goal. I did take in a lot of information, but I wonder if that is how Mindfulness would work in negotiations? Am I properly regulating my emotions by reserving any hasty statements for after I've had time to reflect on the information given to me by them? <br><br>

            I also wonder what kind of references I should gather with this presentation. These things leave some confusion I feel I can overcome, but not without deviating from what the presentation is supposed to be. I was given a lot of information so I was gonna take a break from my next interaction to digest the information and come back with my response to it. <br><br>

            I think this leads me back to my goal. I'm, again, referring to my academic goals, since my spiritual goal is the same: make new disciples. Would my spiritual goal count? If it does, how well can that go if there's no room for interests that support and tie you to  other religious communities/organizations/associations...
