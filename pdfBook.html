        <h2>Section I<br>“Ordinary” People Are Building Peace with Conflict Tools</h2>

        <p>
            As introduced earlier, nonviolent resistance and social movements, like Black Lives Matter and Take Back the
            Streets, are much more effective in toppling dictatorship and ruthless oppression than violence—military,
            terrorist, or any other highly aggressive and organized violent effort. While individuals debate and doubt,
            a growing research body shows the truth. More and more case study examples are demonstrating the
            effectiveness of nonviolent strategic organizing in more and more countries around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
            Restorative justice normally occurs after such destructive violence has occurred and many have suffered. So
            after nonviolent resistance ended apartheid in South Africa, truth and reconciliation occurred to rebuild
            the society. The reader can find myriad other examples.
        </p>

        <p>
            On a smaller, more intimate scale, victim–offender–community mediation occurs after criminal violence when
            the victim(s) requests the opportunity to meet the offender(s), question them about their crime, educate
            them about how they harmed, and then negotiate repair of damage. Victims are hopefully made more whole;
            sometimes relationships are restored and the offender negotiates the conditions for reintegration into
            communities that are willing to consider and welcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            While the following section focuses on introducing nonviolence and its power, the content is relevant to all
            aspects of restorative justice and peacebuilding—even daily living with gardens of delights.
        </p>

        <h3>Peace Culture Is a Culture That Promotes Peaceable Diversity</h3>

        <p>
            The ceaseless culture-creating activity that characterizes the social body involves interaction at every
            level—from the intrapersonal to the interpersonal in household, neighborhood, and community, on through
            successive levels of civic organization from city to the United Nations. Because there is a constant
            interpenetration of levels, the societal capacity for aggression or peacebuilding depends on patterns
            developed in every domain, from the individual and the interpersonal to the national, and interenvironmental
            (<em>emphasis added</em>).

            <hr class="na-rule">

        <p>
            Traditionally, when peace is mentioned, most think of what scholars refer to as
            <span class="strong">negative peace</span>—the absence of war. More recently,
            <span class="strong">positive peace</span> expands the idea to include citizen (second-track) and
            traditional
            peacebuilding. Peace rarely happens by surprise; it’s a purposeful choice built over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            This section introduces second-track diplomacy alongside two widely used conflict-resolution processes:
            <span class="chip">negotiation</span> and <span class="chip">mediation</span>. We also hint at how
            facilitated,
            skillful mediation supports democracy building (good-governance research).
        </p>

        <div class="na-callout">
            <div class="center"><strong>Definition — Second-Track (“People”) Diplomacy</strong></div>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                Informal efforts to prevent war or restore society after war by developing cultures and institutions
                that sustain
                peace—distinct from first-track diplomacy (official state actors like heads of state and ambassadors).
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            High-profile NGOs and citizen activists are often visible in unofficial diplomacy, but many influential
            stakeholders
            work quietly in nonpublic forums. Students of multitrack diplomacy should ask: Who prevents conflict? Who is
            effectively mediating difference?
        </p>

        <p>
            Icons like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Archbishop Desmond Tutu illustrate one essential citizen process:
            <span class="strong">nonviolent resistance</span>—noncooperation with public exposure of injustice—executed
            with
            strong local and global support. Their examples show how ordinary people can join, create, and lead change.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nonviolent resistance scales from micro-conflict interactions to community and political arenas. Parties can
            refuse
            to cooperate with behavior they oppose and, like Gandhi or Dr. King, consistently model higher ground—while
            building strategic alliances to amplify effective, nonviolent strategy.

            <hr class="na-rule">
        </header>

        <p>
            The time is ripe to see a movement insisting on higher moral ground with global conflict resolution. If
            every person
            would discipline themselves to cooperate only with that—acts, relationships, employers, decisions—that
            reflect their
            values, principles, and ideals, one can imagine how incredibly transformative such noncooperation would be:
            for the
            individual, their groups, and society as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
            Yet even Gandhi, arguably the world’s greatest inspiration, strategist, and teacher of nonviolent
            resistance, would
            likely agree that India’s liberation from oppression was only the first step forward—and sadly, actually
            increased
            violence between warring Hindus and Muslims. Building peace requires more than independence, no matter how
            important
            liberation may be.
        </p>

        <div class="na-callout">
            <div class="center"><strong>Reflection</strong></div>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                The continuing violence in liberated Iraq after years of costly warfare brings this painful and
                troubling reality
                close to all Americans. Afghanistan is even worse. An honest witness to history is forced to admit this
                sobering
                truth: brute military force alone—or the threat of it—has not built peace that lasts or spreads through
                a society’s
                communities, poor as well as rich.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Government force—whether military or law enforcement—or violent freedom-fighting resistance, even domestic
            terrorism,
            can only play limited roles in building peace. Instead, what one finds in studying war and the
            military-industrial
            complex (see Paul Joseph’s <em>Encyclopedia of War</em> and <em>Addiction to War</em>) is that powerful
            politicians
            have manipulated and caused war for their own gain and profit. The rest of us—the majority of human
            beings—suffer
            and bear the costs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The seeds of war and all violence are contained in our collective unconscious: the accumulated childhoods of
            generations and all cultures. While this book does not attempt to address these seeds beyond a brief
            introduction to
            what can help counter the effects of growing up in abusive, punitive, and neglectful homes without parental
            love and
            mentoring, neighborhoods terrorized by drug cartels and gangs, and schools where bullying and violence occur
            daily,
            it is critical that we acknowledge all we must heal and address as human beings to survive and eradicate
            violence and
            war.

            This book will not attempt to study governments’ current or best role in building peace—many
            political-science books
            address that debate. Instead, it introduces a much less-studied effort in peacebuilding: the growing role of
            the
            average person or professional concerned with violent conflict, cross-racial and cross-ethnic fighting, and
            a wide

            Building peace requires more than moral will—it requires shared vision and leadership. Seeking and
            protecting
            political leadership whose interests are embedded in their community’s welfare is one of many critical
            challenges.

            Civil society is most often acknowledged as a vital partner in the ongoing work of sustaining peace. Its

            educators, activists, entrepreneurs, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens—serve as bridges between

            Civil society groups often act with greater flexibility than government bureaucracies, allowing them to
            respond
            swiftly and creatively to new issues and concerns. Because of their closeness to people, they can sense
            shifting
            realities and mobilize more quickly than traditional institutions. Visionary initiative frequently creates
            unexpected opportunities. Those who can operate with access to people and networks that can be mobilized
            rapidly can
            take the lead in times of change.

            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                The Oslo Accords were preceded by months of informal communication preparing the ground for formal
                negotiation
                through relationship-building and identifying common ground. Increasingly, formal and informal diplomacy
                merge in
                this way.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The negotiation of South Africa’s transitional constitution brought official and track-two diplomacy
            together. It
            opened meetings to the public through a media campaign, made materials accessible online, and circulated a
            draft
            constitution for public review, comment, and objection. Such transparency embodied democratic participation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Government and business both need independent watchdogs to oversee and stimulate their best performance.
            Nongovernmental organizations often serve this vital role. At its best, informal community diplomacy fills
            critical
            gaps in international capacity. Intranational and cross-ethnic disputes frequently fall outside
            international
            authority. Without track-two alternatives, minority groups may see violent struggle for independence as
            their only
            option.
        </p>

        <p>
            With track-two diplomacy, participants can develop mutual understanding, transform destructive attitudes,
            build
            bridges between rights and responsibilities, and create lasting resolutions. Concrete ways for citizens to
            develop
            democratic capacities are increasingly common.

                New international law and mechanisms now allow citizens to bring grievances—such as human-rights
                violations—
                outside their own state. Businesses craft arbitration processes to avoid national forums. The
                international
                community convenes truth-and-reconciliation commissions and other forums to investigate abuses by both
                citizens

        <p>
            Restorative justice plays an important role in these emerging systems as a strong example of second-track
            diplomacy.
            Truth-and-reconciliation commissions engage the community—including victims of crime and nongovernmental
            organizations—in negotiating repair of harm with offenders who accept responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            Track-two diplomacy raises valid questions about the impact of independent, uncoordinated efforts—especially
            when
            they appear at odds with formal government diplomacy. Yet, given the seemingly impossible challenges that
            traditional diplomacy faces, one can imagine an ideal world where unofficial diplomacy supports official
            efforts,
            perhaps even creating the conditions necessary for their success.

            When informal initiatives relieve some of the pressure on formal systems and correct their failings,
            institutional
            systems are freed to strengthen capacity and realize their ideals. Some government agents are beginning to
            recognize
            this potential and are initiating <span class="chip">multitrack partnerships</span>. The multistakeholder
            process
            behind Europe’s <em>Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making, and
                Justice in
                Environmental Matters</em> stands as a model for democratized multilateral policymaking—an example of
            how global
            institutions can emulate the spirit of participation and transparency.

        <p>
            Which professions are most motivated to make the commitment to track-two diplomacy and play this essential
            leadership role? Unfortunately, many nongovernmental organizations appear more renowned for their
            competition over
            funding than for proactive community partnering and effective peacebuilding. Fortunately, there are
            others—such as
            the <em>International Red Cross</em>—whose reputation and role remain strong.

            Occasionally, grieving parents—such as those who founded <em>Mothers Against Drunk Driving</em> or the
            <em>Women Waging Peace Network</em> after losing loved ones to war—emerge from sorrow to lead movements,
            speak truth
            to power, and transform the conditions of their tragedy. One might imagine that more social workers,
            politicians,
            and law-enforcement officers could be moved to serve their communities in similar ways—and many do, quietly,
            through
            daily unrecognized service.

            In some war-torn societies, doctors and nurses become surprisingly trusted, impartial mediators—though often
            unequipped or untrained to respond effectively to conflict or lead community change. While the public
            celebrates
            heroes, leaders in peacebuilding and conflict resolution never act alone. Like Desmond Tutu during South
            Africa’s
            apartheid, they build critical alliances and rally collective support.

                Ordinary human behavior often pressures family or group members into conformity and submission. It takes
                extraordinary sensitivity and skill to “walk the middle” without being branded a traitor. Our greatest

            Gandhi, once an unsuccessful Oxford-educated lawyer who failed to establish a practice in India, was
            nevertheless
            well prepared for clever rebuttals when later interrogated in British courts. More importantly, he became a

            strategist—aligning with Western media and inspiring the Indian masses toward unity and justice.

            Barack Obama, a community organizer and lawyer, evoked similar memories as he traveled across the United
            States
            during his campaign. He added a modern strategy: like former candidate Howard Dean, he understood how to
            persuade
            and organize the youngest voters electronically as well as through traditional media. In the same way,
            contemporary

            It is likely that there are many unsung heroes of social justice and peacebuilding that most will never

            Federal District Court Judge <em>Thelton Henderson</em> stands out as one example of the impartiality and
            moral
            courage described throughout this book. As a judge rather than a mediator, he consistently asserted the
            moral
            boundaries embedded in the U.S. Constitution—even in the face of great political opposition.

            Negotiation embraces a wide range of strategies and tactics designed to persuade, influence agreement,
            create value,
            solve problems, and resolve disputes. Bargaining can occur between two parties or among many—whether
            domestic or
            international. In truth, we all negotiate daily and often with ourselves: what to prioritize, how to treat
            one
            another, and how to allocate time and attention.

        <h3>Optimally Distributive and Integrative</h3>
        <p>
            When the average person envisions negotiation, they often picture what negotiation scholars call the
            <em>distributive dance</em>—a linear model with a “fixed pie” of limited resources to divide, such as water.
            Buying a
            home or a car illustrates this dynamic clearly. The buyer or seller begins with an opening offer or demand;
            the other
            responds with a counteroffer. Through a sequence of moves and countermoves, the parties proceed to
            <em>split the difference</em>—the distance …

        </header>

        <p>
            Between the two offers, negotiators engage in a predictable dance of proportional and responsive concessions
            until
            they reach agreement through compromise. Most negotiations, however, do not merely involve a “fixed pie” to
            be
            divided. They encompass complex layers of interests and needs that must be explored, identified, and
            satisfied—rather
            than simply split.

            <span class="chip">Integrative bargaining</span>, in contrast to distributive bargaining, assumes
            <span class="chip">interdependence</span>. It is designed to handle complexity and expects that different
            stakeholders will define desired outcomes in their own subjective ways. It does not equate such differences
            in
            perspective with adversarial positioning. Instead, diverse perspectives are studied and reframed in search
            of
            options that maximize satisfaction without requiring a change in mandate.

            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                Roger Fisher, founder of the <em>Harvard Negotiation Project</em>, introduced and popularized
                <strong>interest analysis</strong> as an alternative to positional or power-based bargaining. Rather
                than expecting
                political leaders to abandon their postures, he analyzed them—and then used the principals’ underlying
                interests to
                stimulate creative problem solving.
            </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, framing a complex conflict with linear logic as a simple “either/or” win–lose paradigm
            polarizes the
            parties. Overly confident distributive moves risk escalating hostility, eroding trust, and inciting
            unproductive
            reactions—especially in conflicts involving groups.
        </p>

        <p>
            A study of U.S. lawyers described the least effective negotiators with words such as <em>arrogant</em>,
            <em>stubborn</em>, <em>unethical</em>, and <em>egotistic</em>. Likewise, a global study of multicultural
            leadership in
            conflict processes identified the least effective as <em>closed-minded</em>, <em>judgmental</em>,
            <em>insensitive</em>, <em>negative</em>, and <em>indifferent</em>. Even when a party succeeds in forcing its
            desired
            outcome, the agreement is unlikely to last—and the risk of public scrutiny or backlash is high.

            <div class="center"><strong>International Application</strong></div>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                Distributive bargaining in the international arena makes sense only with truly fixed-resource
                situations, and even
                then it must be exercised with skill to avoid costly fallout. Case studies from the United Nations and
                other
                organizations show that <strong>integrative approaches</strong> produce superior outcomes. Agreements
                reached by
                <span class="chip">consensus</span> are more sustainable and easier to implement than those imposed by
                force.

            Mediators—facilitators of negotiation—are increasingly recognized as adding essential sophistication when
            parties
            lack experience with integrative bargaining. In a global study of multicultural leadership, researchers
            found that
            <strong>careful listening alone</strong> can advance progress, particularly in cross-ethnic negotiation.

            The Afghan student’s perspective asserts that after a long history of distributive failures, resolution
            became
            possible only after finally attempting <span class="chip">interest-based negotiation</span> for the first
            time.
            Sadly, the situation has since deteriorated after twenty years of U.S. military intervention.
        </p>

        <h3>Proven Research and Theories</h3>
        <p>
            Much negotiation research and theory has been criticized for lacking practical usefulness. Short-term
            laboratory
            studies fail to simulate complex, real-world conflict. <em>Howard Raiffa</em>, a renowned game theorist,
            found during
            his international administrative work that negotiators often fail to act in rational or coherent ways,
            undermining
            the predictive power of purely rational models.
        </p>

        <p>
            A few studies, however, are noteworthy exceptions. While many rational theories cannot predict diverse
            cultural or
            irrational behavior, they can still offer insights that make a critical difference in outcomes.

            <div class="center"><strong>Robert Axelrod — Transforming Aggression to Cooperation</strong></div>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                Axelrod’s mathematical research sought optimal strategies for turning aggressive tactics into
                collaborative
                bargaining. His findings were striking: beginning negotiations cooperatively and giving generously
                builds goodwill.
                Otherwise, a defensive, hostile climate quickly forms. Once trust is broken, it is far harder to repair
                than to
                build from the start.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                Yet, goodwill cannot be assumed. Negotiators must remain vigilant, responding strategically to each
                countermove—as
                in a game of chess. If an opponent acts aggressively, a proportional response can signal resilience and
                deter
                exploitation. Then, extending an <em>olive branch</em> invites renewed collaboration. When the
                invitation is
                accepted, hostility is transformed into cooperation—at least for the moment.
            </p>
            <p style="margin:.4rem 0 0 0;">
                If the opponent stubbornly persists in aggression, however, the negotiator must resist firmly rather
                than yield.
